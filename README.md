My final year project for my Computing degreee at Imperial College London. The primary focus was to explore the relationship between speed and security of cross-chain transactions.

## Abstract

In recent years we have seen the monumental growth of capital investment in cryptocurrency projects, an overall growth in the number of projects being released and the growth of the applica-tions that cryptocurrencies and blockchain provide us with. Yet , there is little to no accompanying strides in the connectivity. From a purely socioeconomic perspective, better efforts with the ex-change of information, data and essentially value can create a more paralleled direction of growth for the blockchain and cryptocurrency rather than branching further and further away. An idea, perhaps trivial, is currently far from the conditions we require for mainstream usage. A big contrib-utor to this is due to limitations of speed and security of the infrastructures we have in place today.

This paper formally attempts to quantifies security of cross-chain chain transactions under Proof-of-Work consensus and provides a speed metric comparison derived from the security mechanism aforementioned. Furthermore, in order to be comparable with the more recent paradigm shift to Proof-of-Stake consensus, utilising our cross-chain systematisation, we introduce the early stages for security quantification of PoS blockchains.

Our results indicate that there is in fact a positive correlation between the two to the quanti-fiers, since the transaction direction with the greater requirement of safe confirmations resulted in quicker speeds, partially due to network block propagation times.
